# Text-Recognition-System
AI Project Management  Group K.

This is a project that detect and recognize text from image . This project use Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique such as Deep Learning(DL). 

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.
