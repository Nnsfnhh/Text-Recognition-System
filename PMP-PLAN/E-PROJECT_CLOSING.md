#### 3. Final Project Report
**TEXT RECOGNITION SYSTEM**

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

The text recognition system done by Ravenclaw Inc Company was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to let allow a doctor to write his prescriptions the conventional way (i.e., using their pen and paper). Besides, one of the aims of Ravenclaw Inc Company is to develop a system that are able to recognize the character of the text. Not only that, we also intend to build an application programming interface (API) for the future ease if use as the integration module.

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS**

After the system has been completed, we tested the accuracy of the system. The system is 30%

**3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE**

The project member sticks to the Gantt chart scheduled so, the actual progress fits the original schedule.

**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**

The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system is not able to detect unique text that does not follow the rules set by the government. Unique text that cannot be recognise includes text that are reflective, and also text with special fonts. The system also scopes down the limit of the project by only detect alphabet and number character. Therefore, this system may not be used by countries like China or Thailand, which includes Thai and Mandarin in their text.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**

Ravenclaw Inc Company managed to achieve the objectives initialized since the beginning of the project. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which uses deep-learning technique has been made. Deep learning is used in this project to identify the location of the text on the image and also read the characters on the text. Besides, FAST API is used to implement the python program that are used to recognise the text into a html website. By using this method, our objective of building an API in the system was met.

**5.3 IMPACTS**

By creating this system, ability to automate the process of capturing data from printed and written documents. In a hospital setting, this can include everything from patient charts and medical records, to test results and prescription orders. By automating this process, text recognition systems can help to reduce errors and save time for hospital staff, which can result in improved patient care.Another area where text recognition systems can have a positive impact in hospitals is in the field of medical billing. Text recognition systems can be used to automatically extract and process information from insurance claims and other financial documents, which can help to streamline the billing process and reduce the number of errors that occur.In conclusion, text recognition systems can have a significant positive impact on the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals

**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**



i) Maintain the system

ii) Handling errors and updates of the system

iii) Provide user guidelines to use the system

iv) Report information to senior management on monthly basis
