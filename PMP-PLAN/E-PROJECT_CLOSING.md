**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**

The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system is not able to detect unique text that does not follow the rules set by the government. Unique text that cannot be recognise includes text that are reflective, and also text with special fonts. The system also scopes down the limit of the project by only detect alphabet and number character. Therefore, this system may not be used by countries like China or Thailand, which includes Thai and Mandarin in their text.

Medical records contain a lot of text data, including patient information, diagnosis, and treatment plans. With a text classification system, this information can be automatically organized and indexed, making it easier for doctors and nurses to access and understand patient records. Additionally, the system can be trained to identify specific information, such as symptoms, allergies and test results, which can help to streamline the diagnostic process and ensure that patients receive the appropriate care.As a result, these systems can have a significant impact on improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs in hospitals.

**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**
