# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Scope
  The scope of our product Deep Text Recognition or optical character recognition which perform on a grid infrastructure, is to give users an effective and improved software tool for document processing by reading and identifying characters in research, academic, governmental, and marketing business organisations that have a large pool of documented, scanned images. Regardless of the size or kind of characters in a document, the product recognises them, searches for them, and processes them more quickly in accordance with environmental requirements. 
  The primary objective is to speed the character recognition process in document processing. As a result, the system is able to handle a large number of documents in less time, thereby saving time. Due to the fact that our character identification is built on a grid infrastructure, it tries to recognise several heterogeneous characters that belong to separate global languages with three distinct font attributes and alignments.

### Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which allows Ravenclaw staff to follow the guidelines and achieved the milestone from time to time. The project life cycle WBS breakdown the task and work of every members such as project manager into several modules. Every member have their own roles and part in every stage of the lifecyle based on the constructed WBS. 

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved. Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

  As for the Text Recognition Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructed to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, API management, Text Recognition:
