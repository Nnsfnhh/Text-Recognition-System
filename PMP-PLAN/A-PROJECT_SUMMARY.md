# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
In Thomson Hospital, the doctors or medical staffs are having problems in inefficient data entry processes where they would need to manually entering patients data into electronic medical records where it can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Besides that, they may lack of interoperability between systems where as we know different hospitals and clinics may use different electronic medical record systems which can make it difficult to share patient information. Next, the limited resources in terms of budget and staffing constraints limit of their ability to invest new technologies. Overall, a text recognition system could help to address a range of challenges faced by the doctors and healthcare professionals in managing patient records and data.

In our text recognition system, also known as optical character recognition (OCR) systemss, work by scanning a document or image into the text recognition system. The system would analyzes the document and uses machine learning algorithm to recognize and interpret the text contained within it. The system converts and recognized text into electronic format such as Word document or a PDF file. The electronic text can then be edited, searched, or stored as needed by the hospitals. The text recognition module will be the primary focus of this project. This is the first step toward creating electronic medical records which will reduce the risk of errors caused by manual data entry while also speeding up the process.
