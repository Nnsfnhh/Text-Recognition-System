# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement:
As the hardware, our group use the laptop which consists of intel core i7 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project.

#### Software Requirement:
For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing character of the text in image or document and PHP programming language to design the website and database connection. 

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
Intelligent documnet recognition also known as intelligent document capture or intelligent character recognition (ICR), is a type of technology used to automatically identify and extract information from structured and semi-structured documents. This technology typically uses machine learning algorithms and optical character recognition (OCR) to analyze and interpret the contents of a document. The information that is extracted can then be used for various purposes, such as data entry, document routing, and archiving. It also helps to improve accuracy, speed and efficiency of extracting information from the document.

#### Outcomes of the system
2 main steps will be applied in our system, which is Optical character recognition (OCR) and Information extraction. First it use machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition techniques to extract text from the document images in OCR then it use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to extract structured and unstructured data from the document. This can include things like names, addresses, dates, and other specific information that is relevant to the document.

However, it is worth mentioning that depending on the complexity of the documents and the desired outcome of the process, additional steps like document pre-processing, data validation, and data export may also be necessary.
